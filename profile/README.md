## About Us

Agoriz is a technology organization dedicated to building decentralized infrastructure that empowers individuals with financial sovereignty, privacy, and true freedom.

Founded on the principles of agorism and peer-to-peer exchange, Agoriz develops open-source protocols and tools designed to eliminate intermediaries, custody risks, and surveillance in digital payments and beyond.

We envision a world where every person controls their own digital assets and data without relying on centralized platforms or permissioned systems.

## Our Mission

To create robust, permissionless, and privacy-focused technologies that restore control to individuals, enabling a free and open digital economy.

We strive to build infrastructure that:

* Respects individual sovereignty
* Guarantees absolute privacy
* Eliminates custodial risk
* Operates transparently and auditable
* Is accessible globally without restrictions

## Our Philosophy

At Agoriz, we reject legacy financial models that enforce control through intermediaries, mandatory KYC, and surveillance.

Our work embraces:

* **Individual freedom** over institutional control
* **Self-custody** over third-party custody
* **Permissionless innovation** over gatekeeping
* **Privacy by design** over data exploitation
* **Decentralization** as a non-negotiable foundation

We build not just software but a movement that champions autonomy and economic liberty.

## Our Technology

We develop modular, secure, and scalable blockchain-based protocols that serve as foundational building blocks for decentralized applications.

Our first product, the **Agoriz Protocol**, is a decentralized payment infrastructure designed to enable trustless, non-custodial, private transactions worldwide.

Looking ahead, Agoriz will expand its portfolio to include tools for identity sovereignty, decentralized marketplaces, and privacy-preserving financial services.

## Why Open Source

Transparency and community empowerment are core to our mission.

All our projects are open-source, audited, and free for anyone to use, contribute to, and build upon.

We believe trust is earned through code, not marketing.
