# Agoriz

**Building infrastructure for voluntary exchange.**

## Who we are

Agoriz is a startup focused on payment infrastructure that operates without intermediaries, custody, or permission systems. We build tools that enable direct economic exchange between individuals.

We are driven by the conviction that economic freedom requires technical solutions, not political ones. Every person should be able to transact without exposing their identity, asking for permission, or depending on institutions that decide who participates in the economy.

## What we build

We create decentralized payment systems that solve real problems:

* Custody risk in traditional payment processors
* Mandatory identity verification for basic transactions  
* Geographic restrictions on economic participation
* Opaque fee structures and arbitrary rule changes
* Chargeback exposure for sellers

Our approach is technical, not ideological. We build working systems that preserve individual autonomy through code architecture rather than policy promises.

## Our principles

**Direct ownership**: If funds are yours, no one else should control them.

**Privacy by design**: Identity should not be required for economic participation.

**Transparent operations**: Rules should be mathematical, not bureaucratic.

**Open access**: Geographic location should not determine economic opportunity.

**Predictable costs**: Fees should be algorithmic and verifiable.

## How we operate

We develop with responsibility over publicity. Code is released when it works under pressure, not when it generates attention.

Our funding comes from individuals and organizations who understand the mission. This support respects our complete autonomy in technical and strategic decisions.

We do not seek permission to build systems that restore economic agency to individuals.

## Current focus

Our first product is the Agoriz Protocol, a multi-chain payment gateway supporting Ethereum, Polygon, and other compatible networks. It enables direct peer-to-peer transactions with zero custody and configurable fees.

Additional tools will follow, all designed around the same core principle: technical solutions that give control back to those who create value.
